- 👋 Hello, I’m @yusatia. I also go by yusa!
- 👀 I’m interested in reverse engineering and programming languages and its methodologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Java and Go.

- 🐱‍👤 I'm currently not collaborating in any projects because of my upcoming exams, but you can always hit me up (yusatial@gmail.com) if you need something.
- 🤨 I won't be constantly updating my repositories since everything I work on are prototypes.
